# NextJS-Learning

Private Folders: We use private folders to keep our UI login separate from routing login. This folder will not show in the URL. If we want to show it in the URL, we need to use the %5FfolderName way, and then it will be visible in the URL.


Route Groups: Route groups in Next.js allow you to organize related routes without affecting the URL. For example, pages like register, login, and forgot-password can be grouped in an auth folder while keeping URLs clean and top-level.

layouts: A layout is UI that is shared between multiple pages in our page.
